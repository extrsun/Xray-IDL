You may download the data from 

http://cda.harvard.edu:9011/chaser/mainEntry.jsp

There are several ways to download the Chandra data from the web. They may
result in different directory structures. And the structures may also be
changed on the CXC side. So you need to make sure that the files are in 
right directories:
ls ../primary/*flt* ../primary/*asol*  ../primary/*evt1* ../primary/*evt2*
ls ../secondary/*bpix*
