 This is a slightly revised version of the original meno by Shikui on
 combining few spectrum files together.

 1) copy all the files(including source spectra,  ancrfile, respfile, and 
 background spectra) into one directory, and check the header of spectrum file,
 which should have the correct values for BACKFILE, ANCRFILE (using fv or CIAO
 command dmlist/dmhedit to list or edit these keywords; e.g.,)

 dmlist the_spectrum header,clean,raw | egrep 'BACKFILE|ANCRFILE'
 dmhedit the_spectrum_file  (then following the prompts)

 2) list all the source spectrum files into one file (each line for one file) 
 and all the spectrum are not grouped(or grouped in the exact way,I guess)
 ls *_source_spectrum.pi > infile

 3)run the command addspec with the parameter of error calculation:

  addspec infile errmeth='Gauss' properr='yes'

 (then following the prompts)

 4) You need to have the background spectra combined for each source, even if 
 they are going to be shared by different sources. The addspec add the
 source related scaling information to the combined background spectrum
 (according to what have been told; wqd).

 To get detail information for all the parameters, typing:
 fhelp addspec

 If there is anything still unclear, please let Shikui know.
