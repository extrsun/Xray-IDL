Using your own models in a site-installed version of XSPEC 

To build and use local models in a private directory, after
XSPEC has been installed perform the standard LHEASOFT setup:

      setenv LHEASOFT /software/lheasoft/Linux_2.4_i686
      cd $LHEASOFT/BUILD_DIR
      ./configure
      source $LHEASOFT/lhea-init.csh

In addition, perform the extra ``developers'' setup: 

      source $LHEASOFT/BUILD_DIR/devinit.csh

this will put the hmake script in your path. 
Now, to build your local models, type:

      setenv LMODDIR /data1/dasmith/plem

then cd to the directory: 

      cd $LHEASOFT/../src/spectral/xspec/src/local_mod

and type ``hmake''.  This should build your local models in the
$LMODDIR directory. N.B.  Files named Makefile and setup.dat will be
copied into the directory given by $LMODDIR, so if you have files with
those names, please back them up.  Also, note that if there are any
site-wide installed local models, you will not be able to use these
unless you copy their code and lmodel.dat entries into your $LMODDIR
directory.

If all goes well, at the conclusion of this step, $LMODDIR will
contain a file called libxspec_lfn.so, which is a shared library
containing the local model code.  Finally add $LMODDIR to the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "${LMODDIR}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"

This step must be performed manually by the user, but may be added to
the .login/.profile file.  Note that you must have $MODDIR defined
whenever you run XSPEC with your local models.
