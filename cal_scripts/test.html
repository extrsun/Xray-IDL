<font size=5> Background subtraction procedure in spectral analysis of extended objects</font>
<br>
NOTES:
<pre>
In X-ray imaging spectroscopic data, a "background"refers to signals that are not physically related to the source. In general the background
consists of two components: sky signals and instrumental  signals.  The former  is real X-ray photons collected by the mirror and thus is vignetted. 
The latter is detector electronic signals mostly induced by cosmic high energy particles, and is, as a good approximation, non-vignetted. For detailed
description of the Chandra ACIS instrumental background, refer to http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Links/Acis/acis/Cal_prods/bkgrnd/current/. Also refer
http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/external/xmm_sw_cal/background/index.shtml for similar descriptions of the XMM-Newton EPIC background.
<br>
In spectral studies of extended objects (e.g., diffuse emission), it is by no means straightforward to determine the background. A practical method for
background determination is to use the so-called "blank-sky background", which is compiled from an increasing number of observations toward high
Galacitc latitudes (Markevitch 2000) and serves as a background template. The "blank-sky background" contains both instrumental and sky signals.
However, being a time- and direction-averaged background, the blank-sky background, especially its sky component, could significantly deviate from
the true background of a certain observation. For example, directions toward low Galactic latitudes often suffer from heavy absorption, making the  
sky background along these directions much different from that toward high Galactic lattitudes.
<br>
Therefore, adopting a local background is often the best choice. However often in cases, the source covers a large part (if not all) of the field of view,
leaving little room for the extraction of a clean and statistically significant background spectrum. Moreover, the vignetting effect results in an
apparently uneven sky background, the level of which decreasing from the aim-point of the observation. Even a region for background extraction
is desirable, a direct subtraction of this background from the source spectrum, i.e., without correcting for the vignetting effect, could result in an
under-estimate of the true local background. The proper way to account for the sky background is to adopt the so-called "double-subtraction" procedure,
which consists of two steps: 1)  Direct subtraction of the non-vignetted instrumental background from both the source and total (sky+instrumental)
background spectra; 2)  Subtraction of the sky backround from the instrumental background-removed source spectrum, in terms of a spectral model
component in the fit. This requires a reasonable spectral characterization of the sky background.  An example of the procedure on Chandra ACIS data is
given below.
<br>
1) Extract the source and local background spectra and the corresponding response files for both spectra.
<br>  
     source spectrum: sou.pi, sou.rmf, sou.arf
     background spectrum: bkg.pi, bkg.rmf, bkg.arf
<br>
2) Extract the corresponding instrumental background, i.e., from exactly the same detector regions, for both the source and the background spectra.
    For this purpose, there are the Chandra "stowed background" data and the XMM-Newton "Filter Wheel Closed" data.
<br>  
    instrumental spectrum for the source region: b_sou.pi
    instrumental spectrum for the background region: b_bkg.pi
<br>
3) Set the instrumental spectra as default background for the total spectra
<br>
     fparkey BACKFILE sou.pi b_sou.pi add=yes
     fparkey BACKFILE bkg.pi b_bkg.pi add=yes
<br>
4) Fit the local background spectrum in XSPEC. For high latitude observations, a practical characterization of the sky background is a
combination of a power-law model (PL) and a thermal plasma model (e.g., MEKAL), with the amount of Galactic foreground absorption. The PL
accounts for the collective emission of unresolved distant AGNs dominating high energies (above 2 keV), and the MEKAL accounts for emission
from the Galactic halo and the Local Bubble dominating soft energies (below 2 keV). Fixing the photon-index of the PL  at 1.4 is  practical. Typical
temperatures of the MEKAL are 0.1-0.3 keV.

In IDL:
IDL>  sp_group,'bkg.pi','b_bkg.pi',ctonth=2,fout='bkg.grp'

<br>
grppha bkg.pi bkg_g.pi
GRPPHA[] group bkg.grp
<br>
In XSPEC
XSPEC> data 1:1 bkg_g.pi
XSPEC> ignore 0.0-0.5 7.-**
XSPEC> model wab(po)+wab(mekal)
<br> 
 5) With the best-fit model obtained from the above step, create a fake sky background spectrum for the source region, i.e., with the corresponding response
files.  Notice that the proper sky area for the source region should be considered, i.e., the normalizations of the background models should be rescaled
according to the ratio between the source and background region before the fake spectrum is made.

In XSPEC

For fake data, file #   1 needs response file:  bkg.rmf
                     ... and ancillary response file:   bkg.arf

Input optional fake file prefix (max 5 chars): sky
Fake data filename (skybkg.fak) [/ to use default]: skybkg.fak
Exposure time, correction norm  (1, 1):  30000, 0
<br>
6) Coadd the fake sky background spectrum and the (exposure-normalized) instrumental spectrum to produce an artifical background spectrum as if it was
extracted from the source region. This spectrum, with the vignetting effect corrected for, is to be directly subtracted from the source spectrum. One may then
group and fit the source spectrum.
<br>
In IDL
skyfile='skybkg.fak'
primary=mrdfits(skyfile,0,h0)
skyspec=mrdfits(skyfile,1,h1)
exp=sxpar(h1,'EXPOSURE')
insfile='b_sou.pi'
insspec=mrdfits(insfile,1,hb)
bexp=sxpar(hb,'EXPOSURE')
chan=skyspec.channel
count=skyspec.counts+insspec.counts*exp/bexp
outfile='sou_bkg.fak'

fxhmodify,outfile,'BACKSCAL', 0.04895054621258,ext=1
<br>
7) Alternatively, one may, at step 5) above, jointly fit the source and local background spectra.  This could be a better way to preserve the true counting statistics.
