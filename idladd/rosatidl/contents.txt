Contents and organization of the Rosat IDL library:

     The IDL procedures are stored on the HEASRC Vax workstation under the
account IDL:[LIB.ROSAT]. On the Suns, the procedures are stored under the
account /usr1/source/idl/lib/rosat. The directory is organized into the
following subdirectories: 

      Subdirectory       contains

       experimental      experimental procedure files (extension .pro)
                         All Rosat IDL procedures are currently regarded as
                         experimental.

       working           working procedure files (i.e., those which have been
                         tested and are no longer experimental)

       doc               online help files (extension .txt) and files used
                         by the procedure DOC_LIST (extension .lst)

                         the interface for the higher level procedures

       aux               auxiliary data files (extension .dat) used by 
                         various library procedures (also contains SVDF.DAT 
                         and CONTINENT.DAT from IDL Astronomical Users' 
                         library).

the ASCII help files AAAREADME.TXT or README, which give an introduction to
the Rosat IDL Library The doc subdirectories include the following
additional ASCII help files:
