  Procedures from Astronomical Users' Library for Dealing with Structure
    Variables (November 1993)

    ALIGN_STRUCT :  Check an IDL structure for standard memory alignment 
                    of fields, insert any byte padding required to align 
                    fields on size boundaries, write out new code to define 
                    the aligned version of structure
    COMPARE_STRUCT: Compare all matching Tags names (except for "except_Tags")
                    between two structure arrays (may be different 
                    struct.defs.), and return a structured List of fields 
                    found different
    COPY_STRUCT :   Copy all Fields with matching Tags names (except for 
                    "except_Tags") from one structure array to another 
                    structure array (may be different)
    CREATE_STRUCT : Dynamically create an IDL structure variable from list of 
                    tag names and data types of arbitrary dimensions.   
                    (Useful when the type of structure needed is not known 
                     until run time)
    DDL_STRUCT  :   Convert a DDL record-structure definition file
                    into IDL structure(s) code, packaged as a function
    DDL_TO_STRUCT : Create IDL function code which defines record structure 
                    for DATASET. Check for DDL file (describing DATASET) and 
                    invoke DDL_STRUCT function.
    N_STRUCT    :   Return number of tags in a given structure
    PRINT_STRUCT :  Print the tag names of a structure
    SIZE_STRUCT :   Obtain the size in bytes of an IDL structure definition
    WHERE_TAG   :   Obtain subscripts of elements in structure array 
                    for which a particular Tag has values in a range 
                    or matching specified values
