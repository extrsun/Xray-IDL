    APER        :   Circular APERture photometry
    CNTRD       :   Obtain the centroid a star in an image array
    DAOERF      :   Calculate the intensity, (and optionally, the derivatives) 
                    of a bivariate Gaussian, integrated over pixels.  
                    Called by VALUE
    DAO_VALUE   :   Obtain the value (and optionally, the derivatives) of a 
                    PSF, parameterized as a bivariate Gaussian, and a lookup 
                    table of residuals.  Called by NSTAR and PKFIT
    FIND        :   FIND point sources within an image
    GETPSF      :   Obtain a PSF (gaussian + residuals) from isolated stars.
    GROUP       :   Place stars with non-overlapping PSF's in distinct groups
    MMM         :   (Mean, Median, Mode) sophisticated sky background 
                    computation
    NSTAR       :   Simultaneous PSF fitting of a group of stars 
    PKFIT       :   Fit a gaussian + residuals to a isolated star (called by 
                    GETPSF)
    RDPSF       :   Read a PSF file that was created by GETPSF into an IDL 
                    array.
    REMOVE      :   Contract a vector or up to 6 vectors by removing specified
                    elements
    SKY         :   Compute image sky level using MMM
    SUBSTAR     :   Subtract a scaled PSF at specified star positions
    T_APER      :   Like APER but with I/O to FITS tables
    T_FIND      :   Like FIND but with I/O to FITS tables
    T_GETPSF    :   Like GETPSF but with I/O to FITS tables
    T_GROUP     :   Like GROUP but with I/O to FITS tables
    T_NSTAR     :   Like NSTAR but with I/O to FITS tables
