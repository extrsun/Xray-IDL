How to access the IDL Rosat Library for use at your home institution:

     Rosat GOs may also wish to analyze their data at their home institutions.
The Rosat IDL library is available both via DECNET copy from the HEASRC Vax
workstation on the LHEA Vax cluster, and via anonymous ftp from the GOF account
on the Decstation legacy.nasa.gsfc.gov.


I. via DECNET copy from HEASRC:

     The IDL procedures are stored on the HEASRC Vax workstation under the
account IDL:[LIB.ROSAT].  The directory is organized into the following
subdirectories:

      Subdirectory       contains

     [.EXPERIMENTAL]     experimental procedure files (extension .pro)
                         All Rosat IDL procedures are currently regarded as
                         experimental.

     [.WORKING]          working procedure files (i.e., those which have been
                         tested and are no longer experimental)

     [.DOC]              online help files (extension .txt) and files used
                         by the procedure DOC_LIST (extension .lst)

     [.DEF]              parameter default files (extension .def) used by
                         the interface for the higher level procedures

     [.AUX]              auxiliary data files (extension .dat) used by 
                         various library procedures (also contains SVDF.DAT 
                         and CONTINENT.DAT from IDL Astronomical Users' 
                         library).

You will also need the file startup.pro in IDL:[LIB.COM]. You may find it
useful to copy the file idldef.com from the same directory.

      As an example, to obtain the procedure (extension .pro) files containing 
the code, type

   copy heasrc::idl:[lib.rosat.experimental]*.* (your node and directory)

Please be sure that your institution is running IDL version 2.

     All of the Rosat specific .pro files are stored in the experimental
directory because all of the software is currently experimental. Software will
be moved to the working directory once it has been sufficiently debugged.

     A copy of the Rosat IDL Recipes Cookbook is also stored in the three
*IDL_RECIPES*.TEX files in the [.DOC] subdirectory. Copy all three .TEX
files, and run Latex on the file LX_IDL_RECIPES.TEX. Print as you would
normally print a Latex file. 


II. Via anonymous ftp from the GOF account on legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov:

     The IDL procedure, online help, parameter default, and auxiliary data
files are stored in an uncompressed tar file in the directory
/rosat/software/idl. The subdirectory structure of the original files is
preserved. To reach the GOF account, type: 

     ftp legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov

and at the FTP login prompt type

LEGACY.GSFC.NASA.GOV> login anonymous  (or login ftp)

and give your identity as the password (e.g., your username at your home
institution).  Use the cd command to change to the IDL directory

     cd /rosat/software/idl

To obtain the tar file, type 

     binary                  (the file should be transferred in binary mode)
     get rosat_lib.tar       (what you want to name it)

You will then need to unpack the tar file. If you are on a Unix machine,
you can do this by simply typing 
 
     tar -xvf rosat_lib.tar        (unpacks tar file and creates 
                                    subdirectory structure)

Note that tar should be run from the directory which you wish to be your
IDL top level directory. All of the IDL subdirectories from the tar file
will be subdirectories under this directory. 

(further note: If you are not on a Unix machine, then I don't know how you
should do this. But in that case, why aren't you using DECNET copy?) 
 
     The result will be a set of files in subdirectories under your current
directory. The subdirectory structure will be similar to that used for the
HEASRC account IDL:[LIB.ROSAT], with the obvious Unix translations:
experimental/, working/, doc/, def/, aux/.

     For now, all of the Rosat specific .pro files are stored in the
experimental directory experimental/, because all of the software is currently
experimental. Software will be moved to the working directory once it has been
sufficiently debugged.

     A copy of the Rosat IDL Recipes Cookbook can be also be obtained from
the anonymous ftp account, from directory /software/idl. Pull over all 
three .TEX files, and run Latex on the file LX_IDL_RECIPES.TEX. Print as 
you would normally print a Latex file.

III. Using the IDL Rosat Library at your home institution:

     IDL can be run under both VMS and Unix operating systems. In either case,
the Rosat procedures assume that either some system logicals (VMS) or some
environmental variables (Unix) have been defined (best done before entering 
IDL).

Under VMS, type:

  define zdef   (physical device containing the parameter default .def files)
  define zdoc   (   "                  "        doc_list .lst files)
  define zaux   (   "                  "        auxiliary data .dat files)
  define zcom   (   "                  "        command .com files)
  assign zcom:startup.pro IDL_STARTUP
     
Under Unix, type

  setenv ZDEF   (physical device containing the parameter default .def files)
  setenv ZDOC   (   "                  "        doc_list .lst files)
  setenv ZAUX   (   "                  "        auxiliary data .dat files)
  setenv ZCOM   (physical device containing the command .com files)
  setenv IDL_STARTUP $ZCOM/startup.pro

     You will also need to add the directories which contain the procedure
.pro files to the system logical/environmental variable IDL_PATH (see IDL
manual for more details). 

     You may find it convenient to add these define/setenv commands to your
login.com/login file. 


IV. Don't forget the IDL Astronomical Users' Library:

     The procedures in the Rosat IDL library rely heavily on the IDL
Astronomical Users' Library developed by Wayne Landsman, Frank Varosi, and
others in Code 681 at NASA/GSFC. GOs wishing to use the Rosat IDL library at
their home institution should first obtain the Astronomical Users' Library.
Please be sure that you have the latest versions of the procedures which handle
the Rosat binary FITS extensions. For instructions on how to obtain the
Astronomical Users' Library, contact Wayne Landsman (STARS::LANDSMAN,
LANDSMAN@STARS.GSFC.NASA.GOV).

     Be sure that the definition of your IDL_PATH variable also includes
the directories in which you store the procedure files (*.pro) for the IDL
Users' Library.
