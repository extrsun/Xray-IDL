26 August 1993:


     There have been substantial changes to the library. A number of new
procedures have been added; see contents.txt in the doc subdirectory, or
use DOC_LIST. A specific history of changes/additions can be found in
changes.txt. The most important changes are discussed below:

1. MAKE_PSF now calculates off-axis position angles. The normalization of
   the scattering term has been reduced by 30%, to better match the 
   calibration data.

2. MAKE_LIST now reads photon events data from MPE files. Selection by 
   arrival time, pi energy, and event number are now allowed. A number of
   accepted time intervals can be used to select by arrival time. 
   Procedure TIMEFILTER can be used to time filter an existing photon list 
   over a number of accepted time intervals. Procedure RDACTFIL can be
   used to read in the accepted time intervals from an ASCII file.

3. A procedure MAKE_IMAGE has been added, to accumulate images from a
   photon list structure variable. The photon list can be defined, or
   MAKE_IMAGE can be used to create a photon list according to the 
   specified selection criteria.

4. Procedures RSGETASP, RSGETEVR, RSORB_POS, RSGETHKB, and RSGETHKSTA
   and RSGET_EMAP_DATA read data from MPE format files as well as from US
   format files. Procedures RSASPECT, RSEVRATES, and RSORBIT are being
   modified.

5. Procedures RSGETNOMASP and RSGETSEQINFO will be replaced by RS_NOMASP 
   and RS_SEQINFO, which read information from MPE format headers as
   well as from US format headers.

6. MAKE_SPEC has been fixed to allow spectral binning at full resolution.
   A photon list information structure variable (created by MAKE_LIST) is
   now used to pass the information about the exposure time and number of
   pixels. 

7. Procedure DEFGROUP has been added to define channel groupings for 
   MAKE_SPEC. Procedure SET_RESPFILES has been added to define default
   response matrices for MAKE_SPEC; users should change this procedure in 
   accordance with the default file names at their own institutions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Under development:

   A procedure to calculate exposure maps over selected energy bands,
   using instrument maps created by S. Snowden. The procedure is based
   largely on code contributed by S. Snowden and J. Mendenhall. A very
   preliminary version was released to a few individuals for testing. The
   procedure runs well, but there still appear to be centering problems
   which can lead to a residual "stripes" and images of the support
   structure, especially at the lowest energies. Possible causes and ways
   to fix this problem are being investigated.

   (Please note: This is why you will not yet find the procedure MAKE_EMAP
   in the file rosatlib.tar. We hope to have it ready soon.)

   A procedure to create XSPEC FITS format spectral files

   A procedure to accumulate images directly from photon events FITS files,
   without first creating a photon list structure variable. The procedure
   is meant to use less memory and run faster when dealing with very large 
   files.

   Procedures to calculate background maps, based on maps created by 
   S. Snowden and code developed by S. Snowden and J. Mendenhall

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The following specific procedures have been added to the library:

    DEFGROUP      : Defines channel groupings for make_spec and make_pha
    GET_POSI      : Finds number of elements for each unique value in a
                    vector (contributed by Q. D. Wang)
    MPE_GTIMES    : Reads the _events.tfits header (MPE format data) and 
                    returns the selected times 
    MPE_SEQINFO   : Reads sequence information from the sequence header for
                    a ROSAT (MPE format) FITS file
    RDACTFIL      : Reads ASCII file of accepted time intervals, with one
                    interval (start and stop times) per line
    RSGTIMES      : Reads either the MPE format selected times or the US 
                    format good time intervals 
    RSOBSDATE     : Reads the observation date from the Rosat photon list FITS
                    file headers (e.g., rp123456.fits or wp123456_events.tfits)
    RS_NOMASP     : Reads nominal aspect information from the sequence header 
                    for a ROSAT FITS file (will replace RSGETNOMASP)
    RS_SEQINFO    : Reads sequence information from the sequence header for
                    a ROSAT FITS file (will replace RSGETSEQINFO)
    SET_RESPFILES : Defines a system variable containing the default response
                    matrices to be used in make_pha
    TIMEFILTER    : Allows user to select data from a photon list structure 
                    for times within a specified interval or intervals
    TIMEINTSECT   : Finds the time intervals which are the intersections
                    between one interval and a set of intervals
    TINTSECT2     : Finds the time intervals which are the intersections
                    between two sets of time intervals
    US_GTIMES     : Reads the _events.tfits header (US format data) and 
                    returns the good time intervals
    US_SEQINFO    : Reads sequence information from the sequence header for
                    a ROSAT (US format) FITS file
    VSORT         : Finds the unique values in a vector, when the entries will
                    be quantized more coarsely
    VSORT_LARGE   : Same as VSORT, except for large vectors (>10,000 elements)

15 July 1992


     A new routine, MAKE_PSF, has been added. Given an input PSPC spectrum,
the routine uses Gunther Hasinger's algorithm to calculate the expected
on-axis PSPC point spread function, as both a 2 dimensional image and as a
radially averaged profile. The image and/or profile may be written to disk
(as simple FITS and ST SDAS binary table files, respectively) if desired.
The input spectrum may be read from several different types of files. 

For local users of IDL:

     A new way to define the IDL_PATH variable (on the HEASRC cluster only)
is being tested. If you are currently using (on HEASRC) any of the new
routines that use the new FITS readers, then you should try this out! To do
so, just type (*before* getting into IDL): 

$ define idl_path xanadu:[idl_lib.rosat.experimental], -
  "+xanadu:[idl_lib.idlaul]", -
  "@idl_dir:[lib]userlib.tlb"

This supersedes the previous definition of IDL_PATH in zcom:idldef.com.
(If you are using zcom:idldef.com, then obviously you want to redefine
IDL_PATH *after* typing @zcom:idldef.)

     If you are typing @newfits.setup once you get into IDL, then it is
important that you use the new definition for IDL_PATH. Otherwise, IDL may
not compile the newest versions of all of the routines.

     These remarks are of interest only to IDL users on the HEASRC cluster.
If you only use IDL on the Suns, then you can safely ignore them.

     Please report any problems to Gail Reichert.

5 June 1992

     New general FITS readers are now available in the IDL Astronomical
Users' Library. These allow ASCII and Binary table extensions to be read
directly from the FITS file. Rosat library procedures which used the old
FITS readers (i.e., those which read the files created by DFITSRD) have 
been modified to use these new readers (and are *much* faster as a result). 
These procedures are:

     rsaspect, rschecktsi, rsevrates, rsgetasp, rsgetevr, rsgethkb, 
     rsgethksta, rsorbit, and rsorb_pos

The procedures have not (yet) been added to the experimental library.
Local users who wish to try them out may do so by getting into IDL,
and then typing 

IDL> @explib:newfits.setup      (VMS)     or 
IDL> @$EXPLIB/newfits.setup     (Unix)

which will compile new versions of these procedures. To return to using the
old procedure (e.g., rsaspect), type

IDL> .run explib:rsaspect       (VMS)     or
IDL> .run $EXPLIB/rsaspect      (Unix)

NOTE: The new procedures read data from the FITS files directly. IT IS NO
LONGER NECESSARY TO CONVERT THESE FILES USING DFITSRD. The new versions
will not work with files created using DFITSRD.

     We plan to add these routines to the experimental library soon.

     There have been substantial changes to the library! A number of new
procedures have been added; see Contents.txt in the doc subdirectory, or
use DOC_LIST. A specific history of changes/additions can be found in
Changes.txt. These help files can also be found in the IDL subdirectory in
the GOF anonymous ftp account (/home/heasfs/ftp/pub/IDL) under the obvious
corresponding file names.
