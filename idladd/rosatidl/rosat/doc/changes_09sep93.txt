           procedures calcpsfh and rspsfh added, procedure make_psf_hdr 
           modified to match

           to allow user to scale PSF image and radially averaged profile
           so peak values = 1, and (if the spectrum is read from a file)
           to allow user to select minimum and maximum channel energies to 
           be included in the calculation; keyword CHATTER added to
           procedure calcpsfp

20-Jul-92: Procedures match_files and readfits modified to explicitly make
           sure that all logical units are freed upon exiting procedure.
           This was done because sometimes logical units were being left
           open, and when the routine was run many times, eventually no
           free logical units would be left. This has the disadvantage that
           all logical units which are open when either routine is started
           are also freed after these routines are run. The modified version
           of readfits is temporarily stored in readfits_new.pro. 
           Bug in procedure make_list also fixed.
