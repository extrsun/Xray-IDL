  Image Manipulation Procedures from Astronomical Users' Library (Nov 1993)

    (see also procedures under topics "IMDISP" and "PLOT")

    BOXAVE      :   Boxave an image, always using at least REAL*4 arithmetic
    CONVOLVE    :   Convolution of image with Point Spread Function (PSF)
                    (using product of Fourier transforms as default option)
    CORREL_IMAGES : Computes the 2-D cross-correlation function of two 
                    images for a range of (x,y) shifting by pixels of 
                    one image relative to the other
    CORREL_OPTIMIZE : Find the optimal (x,y) pixel offset of image_B relative 
                      to image_A, by means of maximizing the correlation 
                      function
    CORRMAT_ANALYZE : Analyze the 2-D cross-correlation function of two images
                      and find the optimal(x,y) pixel offsets
                      (intended for use with function CORREL_IMAGES)
    DIST_CIRCLE :   Create an array where each pixel value is equal to its 
                    distance to a specified center. Useful for circular 
                    aperture photometry.
    DIST_ELLIPSE :  Create a mask array useful for elliptical aperture 
                    photmetry.
    FILTER_IMAGE :  Computes the average and/or median of pixels in moving box,
                    replacing center pixel with the computed average and/or 
                    median, (using the IDL smooth or median functions)
                    (allows pixels at edges and corners to be processed, 
                    and iterative smoothing simulating convolution with 
                    gaussian to be applied)
    IMLIST      :   Display pixel values on an image surrounding a specified 
                    X,Y center (similar to TVLIST)
    MAX_ENTROPY :   Deconvolution of data by Maximum Entropy analysis, 
                    given the instrument point spread response function 
                    (spatially invariant psf)
    MAX_LIKELIHOOD : Deconvolution of an observed image (or spectrum), given 
                     the instrument point spread response function (spatially 
                     invariant psf)
    MEDARR      :   (MEDian ARRay) Create a 2-d image from a 3-d array taking 
                    a median filter across the third dimension.  Also 
                    available as a C function.
    PSF_GAUSSIAN :  Return a point spread function having Gaussian profiles,
                    as either a 1D vector, a 2D image, or 3D volumetric-data
    RINTER      :   Cubic interpolation of an image at a set of reference points
    SIGMA_FILTER :  Computes the mean and standard deviation of pixels in a box 
                    centered at each pixel of the image, but excluding the 
                    center pixel
