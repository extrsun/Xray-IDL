  SERTS Graphics Device Procedures from Astronomical Users' Library (Nov 1993)

    (DEVICELIB adds the system variables used by these procedures)

    DEANZA      :   Sets the graphics device to the DEANZA display
    DEVICELIB   :   Defines variables and common blocks needed for the SERTS 
                    graphics device library.
    FORM_FILENAME : Tests whether or not a given filename already has an
                    extension on it, and if not appends a default extension
    GET_VIEWPORT :  Gets the current values of the viewport, in the form of the
                    old-fashioned variables !SC1, !SC2, !SC3, and !SC4.
    HAVE_WIDGETS :  Tests to see whether the current graphics device supports 
                    widgets
    HAVE_WINDOWS :  Tests to see whether the current graphics device supports 
                    windows
    IVAS        :   Sets the graphics device to the IVAS display.

                    PCL plot files
    PCLCLOSE    :   Close an HP LaserJet PCL plot file and reset the graphics 
                    device
    PCLPLOT     :   Print an HP LaserJet PCL plot file and reset the graphics 
                    device
    PSCLOSE     :   Close a PostScript plot file and reset the graphics device
    PSPLOT      :   Send a PostScript plot file generated by IDL to the

    QMCLOSE     :   Close a QMS plot file and reset the graphics device
    QMPLOT      :   Send a QMS plot file generated by IDL to the QMS laser 
                    printer
    QMS         :   This procedure sets the system variables needed to write 
                    QMS plot files
    REGIS       :   Resets to REGIS mode
    RESET       :   Resets the system variables for the currently selected 
                    device, and sets the system variables !LINETYPE, !PSYM, 
                    !NOERAS, !XTITLE, !YTITLE, !MTITLE, !XTICKS, and !YTICKS
                    to their defaults
    SCREEN      :   Resets to Tektronix 4010 mode
    SETPLOT     :   Switches among the various available plotting devices
    SETSCALE    :   Sets the plot scale such that it is the same in the X and 
                    Y directions
    SETVIEW     :   Allow several plots on one page, arranged horizontally 
                    and/or vertically
    SETWINDOW   :   Allow switching between windows, while retaining separate 
                    graphics parameters for each
    SHOW_QUEUE  :   Show the contents of a print queue
    SMALLWINDOW :   This procedure creates or recreates a window which is 
                    smaller than the average size
    SUN         :   Switch to SunView mode
    TEK         :   Sets graphics device to Tektronix 4010 mode
    TEK4105     :   Sets the graphics device for Tektronix 4100 series or above 
                    terminals
    TEK4211     :   Sets the graphics device for the Tektronix 4211 color 
                    terminal
    TEKMONO     :   Sets the graphics device for Tektronix 4100 series or above 
                    terminals
    TRIM        :   Convert numbers into a string representation, and trim off 
                    leading and/or trailing blanks
    WIN         :   Switch to Microsoft Windows mode
    X           :   Switch to X-windows mode
    XTERMINAL   :   Set the graphics device to X-windows with a particular 
                    window size and backstorage mode
