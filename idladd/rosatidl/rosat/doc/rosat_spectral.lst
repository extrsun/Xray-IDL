  
  SPECTRAL :    Procedures (and functions) useful for spectral analysis

    MAKE_PHA    :   Write spectrum into XSPEC format .PHA files
    MAKE_SPEC   :   Construct spectrum from photon list, using arbitrary 
                    channel groupings and blocking factors 
    READ_ASPC   :   Read an ASCII spectral file created by WRITE_ASPC
    WRITE_ASPC  :   Write spectral data to ASCII file  
                    Useful for transferring spectral data created under
                    VMS to Unix for spectral fitting in XSPEC
