  
  MISC :    Miscellaneous procedures (and functions) useful for Rosat data 
            analysis

    ROSATLIB    :   Add system variables required for Rosat IDL procedures.
                    Calls ASTROLIB from IDL Astronomical Users' Library.

    CREATE_STRUCT:  Create an IDL structure variable from list of tag names
                    and data types
    FILLBOX     :   Calculate the x and y positions of all pixels contained
                    within a rectangle.
    FILLREGION  :   Calculate the x and y positions of all pixels
                    contained within an arbitrary straight-sided region.
    FILLSIMPLE  :   Calculate the x and y positions of all pixels
                    contained within an arbitrary, straight-sided,
                    simple region (i.e., a region where all vertices point 
                    away from the center).
    FINDSTR     :   Find all occurences of one substring within another.
    FITSDUMP    :   Dump the contents of the first n records of all fields
                    in a FITS table file.
    GETBORDER   :   Calculate the x and y positions of all pixels along a
                    straight-sided boundary.
    GETNOMASP   :   Read nominal aspect information (roll, RA, Dec) from
                    a Rosat FITS header
    GETOBIEVR   :   Given up to 5 quantities, find intervals during which
                    all quantities are nonzero (for plotting event rates
                    data)
    GETPLOTINTS :   Find large gaps within a time interval (for plotting)
    MAKE_CONTINENT: Read ASCII contours and write into a file for CONTINENT
    MATCH_FILES :   Search a directory for files of a given rootname and
                    description.
    NINTREG     :   Return integer values closest to values in X & Y vectors.
                    Values may be added so that the entire ranges of both 
                    X & Y are encompassed.
    PARSE_TIME  :   Convert a (PROS style) ASCII descriptor for time filtering 
                    into start and stop times
    RSGETPAR    :   Set values of input parameters for various procedures.
                    Calls RSGETDEFPAR, RSSETPARVAL.
    RSGETSEQINFO:   Read sequence information from the sequence header for
                    a Rosat FITS file
    RSOBITIMES  :   Read OBI start and end times from a Rosat FITS header
    SCT2UT      :   Convert spacecraft clock times read from Rosat files 
                    (given in seconds since launch) to UT 
    TIMESEQ     :   Convert UT seconds to fractional days, i.e. a sequential 
                    time vector, using OBINFO
    TIMESTR     :   Convert start and stop time vectors into a PROS style ASCII
                    string for time filtering
    TO_BIN      :   Translate a non-negative decimal integer to a binary string
    TO_HEX_LARGE:   Translate a non-negative decimal integer to a hexadecimal 
                    string. Same as but also works for > 128 elements.
    UT2SCT      :   Convert UT seconds time (seconds from beginning of day)
                    to spacecraft clock time (seconds from launch) using
                    structure variable OBINFO
    WRITESTR    :   Write a vector of ASCII strings to an output file
                    (one element per line)
