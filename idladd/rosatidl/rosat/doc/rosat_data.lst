                    photon list structure variable
    RS_SOURCES  :   Read info on sources in a source list file (e.g.,

    RSCHECK_SOURCES:  Check sources in SASS source table against objects in

    TIMESTR     :   Convert start and stop time vectors into a PROS style ASCII
                    string for time filtering
                    structure variable OBINFO
    WRITESTR    :   Write a vector of ASCII strings to an output file
