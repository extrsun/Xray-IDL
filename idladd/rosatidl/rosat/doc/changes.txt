           to be compatible

03-Oct-93: Procedures doc_list and qual_options changed to use system variable 
           !docdir as default directory, to make running doc_list 
           transparent at other sites
           Procedure make_emap changed to make a FITS header and update it 
           even if no output file is written
           Procedure fixobinfo added to library

01-Oct-93: Procedure defimap changed to use system variable !imapdir as default 
           directory for detector map files, to make running make_emap
           transparent at other sites
           Procedure rsgetdefpar changed to be compatible with new definition 
           of !defdir = getenv('ZDEF') 

30-Sep-93: Procedure make_emap changed to use keyword IMAPDIR to allow 
           instrument maps to be read from different directories

28-Sep-93: Procedure make_emap changed to add information to FITS header 
           created by new make_emap_hdr (and to recreate this for every band)

27-Sep-93: Procedure make_emap_hdr changed to start from detector map FITS 
           header, to use Bill Thompson's FX... routines, to extract header 
           info from MPE as well as US processed events table headers, and to 
           make a proper FITS header

23-Sep-93: Procedure defimap changed to use keyword DIR, and to remove
           scale factor from output list 
           Procedure make_emap changed to use CALDB detector maps which 
           contain the scale factor as a keyword, and to include more comment 
           lines from Steve Snowden's original program
           Procedure rslivetime changed to include the additional 0.0001 sec
           deadtime per acepted event, which compensates for the removal
           of all events less than 0.35 ms after a previous event (done to 
           remove some of the the AP background).
           Procedure rsget_emap_data changed to clean things up a bit

16-Sep-93: Term in scattering norm in procedure rspsfp changed from 0.059*0.7
           to 0.075 (Gunther Hasinger's newest value)

14-Sep-93: Procedure make_emap changed to imbed detector matrix in a 513 by 513
           array before rotation, so that ROT will work properly; also to
           remove user ability to shift map in x & y as this is no longer needed
           Procedure make_emap_hdr changed to take info about shift out, as 
           the shift is no longer necessary

12-Sep-93: Procedure mexdiv added to library

10-Sep-93: Procedure rspsfp changed to fix bug in defining Gaussian sigma and
           to incorporate fix for norm of the scattering fraction
           Procedure rs_sources fixed to work with new version of create_struct
