For local users of IDL:

     A new way to define the IDL_PATH variable (on the HEASRC cluster only)
is being tested. If you are currently using (on HEASRC) any of the new
routines that use the new FITS readers, then you should try this out! To do
so, just type (*before* getting into IDL): 

$ define idl_path xanadu:[idl_lib.rosat.experimental], -
  "+xanadu:[idl_lib.idlaul]", -
  "@idl_dir:[lib]userlib.tlb"

This supersedes the previous definition of IDL_PATH in zcom:idldef.com.
(If you are using zcom:idldef.com, then obviously you want to redefine
IDL_PATH *after* typing @zcom:idldef.)

     If you are typing @newfits.setup once you get into IDL, then it is
important that you use the new definition for IDL_PATH. Otherwise, IDL may
not compile the newest versions of all of the routines.

     These remarks are of interest only to IDL users on the HEASRC cluster.
If you only use IDL on the Suns, then you can safely ignore them.

     Please report any problems to Gail Reichert.

     New general FITS readers are now available in the IDL Astronomical
Users' Library. These allow ASCII and Binary table extensions to be read
directly from the FITS file. Rosat library procedures which used the old
FITS readers (i.e., those which read the files created by DFITSRD) have 
been modified to use these new readers (and are *much* faster as a result). 
These procedures are:

     rsaspect, rschecktsi, rsevrates, rsgetasp, rsgetevr, rsgethkb, 
     rsgethksta, rsorbit, and rsorb_pos

The procedures have not (yet) been added to the experimental library.
Local users who wish to try them out may do so by getting into IDL,
and then typing 

IDL> @explib:newfits.setup      (VMS)     or 
IDL> @$EXPLIB/newfits.setup     (Unix)

which will compile new versions of these procedures. To return to using the
old procedure (e.g., rsaspect), type

IDL> .run explib:rsaspect       (VMS)     or
IDL> .run $EXPLIB/rsaspect      (Unix)

NOTE: The new procedures read data from the FITS files directly. IT IS NO
LONGER NECESSARY TO CONVERT THESE FILES USING DFITSRD. The new versions
will not work with files created using DFITSRD.

     We plan to add these routines to the experimental library soon.

     There have been substantial changes to the library! A number of new
procedures have been added; see Contents.txt in the doc subdirectory, or
use DOC_LIST. A specific history of changes/additions can be found in
Changes.txt. These help files can also be found in the IDL subdirectory in
the GOF anonymous ftp account (/home/heasfs/ftp/pub/IDL) under the obvious
corresponding file names.
