03 March 1994

Changes made to the library since 09 Sep 1993 are documented in the file
changes.txt. The most important changes since 04 Jan 1994 are that bugs
have been fixed in procedure make_list, and the off-axis parameterization
for the HRI psf has been added to procedures rspsfh, calcpsfh, make_psf,
and rsprofile. Procedures to compute UT and modified Julian dates from
(corrected) spacecraft clock times, and for calculating quantities related
to the Geomagnetic field at the position of the satellite, have also been
added. 

Please note that in PROS 2.3, when the position ordered photon events FITS file
is converted to .qp format, and then converted back to FITS format, the 
header of the new FITS file is updated to the new rationalized (RDF) format,
but the structure of the data in the FITS file remains unchanged. The 
procedure make_emap_hdr has been updated to allow exposure maps to be made 
using position ordered FITS files which have been rewritten in this manner.
Please alert G. Reichert (reichert@heasrc.gsfc.nasa.gov; heasrc::reichert) 
if similar problems are found when using any of the other IDL routines.

Please also note that the Rosat IDL procedures have not (yet) been updated to 
be compatible with the newest release of the IDL Astronomy Users' Library
(04 Feb 1994).

04 January 1994

Changes made to the library since 09 Sep 1993 are documented in the file
changes.txt. The most important change since 19 Nov 1993 is that the
following procedures have been updated to work with files in the new
rationalized (RDF) formats:

RSASPECT, RSEVRATES, RSORBIT, RSCHECKTSI, RSGETASP, RSGETEVR, RSORB_POS,
RSORB_PLOT, RSGETHKB, RSGETHKSTA, MAKE_EMAP, MAKE_EMAP_HDR,
RSGET_EMAP_DATA, MAKE_LIST, RSGTIMES, RSLIVETIME, RSOBITIMES, RSOBSDATE,
RS_NOMASP, RS_SEQINFO, RS_SOURCES 

In most cases this was done by converting the RS... routines to shell
routines calling the corresponding OLD... or RDF... routine, depending on
file format. Previous RS... routines were renamed to OLD... (e.g.,
RSGETASP to OLDGETASP, etc.) and new RDF... routines were added. 

In addition, RSGETEVR now returns all of the events rates and counters in
the ancillary file; the command syntax has been changed and the tag names
in the output data structures have been simplified. RSGETASP now returns
aspect quality as well as spacecraft attitude, and the name of RSGETASPQU
has been changed to OLDGETASPQU. RS_SOURCES also now uses the parameter 
interface. Writing privileges are no longer required in order to run
RS_SOURCES.

19 November 1993

Changes made to the library since 09 Sep 1993 are documented in the file
changes.txt. The most important change is that a few routines (RSMAKE_PROF,
RSPSFPROF, RSPROFILE) have been added to allow users to 1) compute an
observed radially averaged profile and 2) to compare this with the best
matching point source response function. 

**************************************************************************

04 October 1993:

     MAKE_EMAP, the procedure to calculate mean exposure maps for Rosat
PSPC pointed observations, has been added to the library. The procedure is
based on code contributed by J. Mendenhall (Penn State Univ). See the file
make_emap.help for details on how to run it. Other important changes are
listed below: 

1. RSLIVETIME was changed to include the additional 0.0001 sec deadtime per
   acepted event, which compensates for the removal of all events less than
   0.35 ms after a previous event (done to remove some of the the AP
   background). 

2. The normalization of the scattering term in the PSPC PSF was changed to
   match G. Hasinger's current best value.

3. ROSATLIB now defines IDL system variables !docdir and !imapdir. This
   was done to make running these routines more transparent at other 
   institutions, and also to allow users to change the defaults within IDL.
   !docdir and !imapdir are set to the values of the system logicals/
   environmental variables ZDOC and ZIMAP. The definition of !defdir was also 
   changed, and RSGETDEFPAR was changed to match.

4. Procedure MEXDIV has been added to allow users to divide PSPC images by 
   mean exposure maps. Corrections are applied only to those pixels for
   which the exposure map is greater than some threshold fraction of the
   total exposure time. This sets a maximum limit to the multiplicative
   correction of 1./threshold. The procedure also defines a mask image,
   which locates the rib structure and outer edge of the exposure map.

5.  Procedure FIXOBINFO has been added to allow users to fix the OBINFO
    structure variable when reading data from MPE format ancillary files.

**************************************************************************

26 August 1993:


     There have been substantial changes to the library. A number of new
procedures have been added; see contents.txt in the doc subdirectory, or
use DOC_LIST. A specific history of changes/additions can be found in
changes.txt. The most important changes are discussed below:

1. MAKE_PSF now calculates off-axis position angles. The normalization of
   the scattering term has been reduced by 30%, to better match the 
   calibration data.

2. MAKE_LIST now reads photon events data from MPE files. Selection by 
   arrival time, pi energy, and event number are now allowed. A number of
   accepted time intervals can be used to select by arrival time. 
   Procedure TIMEFILTER can be used to time filter an existing photon list 
   over a number of accepted time intervals. Procedure RDACTFIL can be
   used to read in the accepted time intervals from an ASCII file.

3. A procedure MAKE_IMAGE has been added, to accumulate images from a
   photon list structure variable. The photon list can be defined, or
   MAKE_IMAGE can be used to create a photon list according to the 
   specified selection criteria.

4. Procedures RSGETASP, RSGETEVR, RSORB_POS, RSGETHKB, and RSGETHKSTA
   and RSGET_EMAP_DATA read data from MPE format files as well as from US
   format files. Procedures RSASPECT, RSEVRATES, and RSORBIT are being
   modified.

5. Procedures RSGETNOMASP and RSGETSEQINFO will be replaced by RS_NOMASP 
   and RS_SEQINFO, which read information from MPE format headers as
   well as from US format headers.

6. MAKE_SPEC has been fixed to allow spectral binning at full resolution.
   A photon list information structure variable (created by MAKE_LIST) is
   now used to pass the information about the exposure time and number of
   pixels. 

7. Procedure DEFGROUP has been added to define channel groupings for 
   MAKE_SPEC. Procedure SET_RESPFILES has been added to define default
   response matrices for MAKE_SPEC; users should change this procedure in 
   accordance with the default file names at their own institutions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Under development:

   A procedure to create XSPEC FITS format spectral files

   A procedure to accumulate images directly from photon events FITS files,
   without first creating a photon list structure variable. The procedure
   is meant to use less memory and run faster when dealing with very large 
   files.

   Procedures to calculate background maps, based on maps created by 
   S. Snowden and code developed by S. Snowden and J. Mendenhall

   A procedure to allow users to remove point sources when analyzing images
   of extended emission
