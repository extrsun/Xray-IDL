     IDL is currently one means by which Rosat GOs can access the data
contained within the anciliary and data FITS files (e.g., calibration,
aspect, housekeeping) for their observations. There are also IDL procedures
which allow users to perform various analysis tasks (e.g., construction of
energy dependent mean exposure maps). This file summarizes how to access
IDL using GOF computers. For futher information on:

The help files can be found in the IDL subdirectory of the GOF
anonymous ftp account on legacy (128.183.8.233) (rosat/software/idl),
and also in the ZDOC directories (idl:[lib.rosat.doc],
/usr1/source/idl/lib/rosat/doc) under the obvious corresponding file
names. A cookbook of IDL recipes for Rosat can also be found in the Latex
files (extension .TEX; get all three and run Latex on LX_IDL_RECIPES.TEX,
then print) and/or the file IDL_RECIPES.ps (all on legacy in software/idl).

     IDL can be run under VMS, Unix, and Ultrix operating systems. At
present, at the GOF we have licenses to run IDL on the HEASRC cluster
(VMS), on the rosserv, xtelab, ros9, ros16, and heasfs Sun workstations
(Unix), and on the legacy Decstation (Ultrix).

     The most recent 2 versions of the ROSAT IDL library are available in
this directory (as .tar files). Energy-dependent instrument maps (required
for constructing mean exposure maps for PSPC observations) can be found in
the calibration areas (caldb:[data.rosat.pspc.cpf], caldb/data/rosat/pspc/cpf)
in the files det*.fits. The complete set of instrument maps will require
26,025 blocks or 13.320 Mbytes of disk space.
