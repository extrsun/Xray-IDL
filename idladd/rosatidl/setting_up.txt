 Setting up your system to run IDL using the ROSAT library routines:

 I. Unix
   1. Set the following environmental variables in your .login file (The
      text following the capital letters are examples for the GSFC system
      only.  You the user must supply directory pointers appropriate for
      your system.).

      source /usr1/source/idl/lib/com/.idlrc

   2. Start IDL.

 II. VMS
   1. Define system logicals IDL_PATH, ZDOC, ZDEF, and ZAUX for your
      system's appropriate directories.
      
      @idl:[lib.com]idldef

   2. Start IDL

III. Don't forget the IDL Astronomical Users' Library:

          The procedures in the Rosat IDL library rely heavily on the IDL
     Astronomical Users' Library developed by Wayne Landsman, Frank Varosi, 
     and others in Code 681 at NASA/GSFC. GOs wishing to use the Rosat IDL 
     library at their home institution should first obtain the Astronomical 
     Users' Library. Please be sure that you have the latest versions of the 
     procedures which handle Rosat binary FITS extensions. For instructions 
     on how to obtain the Users' Library, contact Wayne Landsman 
     (STARS::LANDSMAN, LANDSMAN@STARS.GSFC.NASA.GOV).

          Be sure that the definition of your IDL_PATH variable also includes
     the directories in which you store the procedure files (*.pro) for the 
     IDL Users' Library.
