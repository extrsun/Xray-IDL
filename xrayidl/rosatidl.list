Analysis [.analysis]

filter_sgti - select indeces (in an input time vector) covered by a "good
		time intervals
filter_spatial - conduct a spatial filtering of a photon list with an input
		spatial filter
filter_time - conduct a time filtering
get_bimage - get a broad band image (e.g. in channel interval R4-R7) 
get_edge - get the boundaries of an image partially covered by an array
get_image - get various types of images, including exposure, count, source
		subtracted exposure, flat fielding and mask image.
get_interval - determine time intervals in a time vector
getlistimage - get a photon list and the corresponding image
hist_area - get the histogram of area as a function of off axis
image_add - a function used to add images to an array
image_center - determine the center of an observation
image_comp - compress or expand an image 
image_cut - cut an inner circle or an area outside a radius from an image
iras_sub

Shadow experiment [rosat.shadow]
bin_pixel - select pixels in an image according to the selected bins
		in an array which can be on different scales.
dis_flux - calculate an one dimension distribution of X-ray surfance brightness
		of an image
fit_ab - conduct a fit of images (upto three different energy bands) to an
	 imput absorbing gas distribution (e.g., an IRAS 100um image)
get_opacity - get broad energy band absorption as a function of column density
image_comb - form arrays containing three images in three different energy 
		bands
int_opacity - get an integrated opacity
map_nh - derive an absorbing gas column density map from X-ray absorption as
		observed in an X-ray image
opacity - read a file containing opacity data for a particular band and
		emission spectrum (the file is derived from XSPEC)
plot_ab - plot the model fit to the abservaed flux as a function of opacity
sel_data - form count, back, time vectors from selected pixels in corresponding
		images. (called by fit_ab)


Utility [rosat.utility]
min_image - get minimum values and locations in individual columns or rows
		in an image
